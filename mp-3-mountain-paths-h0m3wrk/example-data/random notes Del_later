//Objective, what they want us to learn
-Read from and write to files using ifstream and ofstream respectively; ensure stream integrity is maintained throughout these processes; 
    able to distinguish between different stream states.
-Understand the differences between argument passing modes (value, reference) in the C++ language and communicate their appropriate usage.
//Background, what to do...
-Read in elevation data, process it, and then print out a grayscale topological image map. 
This map will have multiple potential paths drawn on it in red with the best recommended path in green.

//Format,
-Two dimensional vecor(matrix) of elevations
std::vector<std::vector<int>> elevations points in our path;
